# Lodgr — Affordable Event-Based Accommodation Platform

Lodgr is a next-generation accommodation marketplace designed for global mega-events such as the FIFA World Cup, Olympics, F1 races, major concerts, and large conventions. Unlike traditional platforms, Lodgr integrates paid couch-surfing, budget shared rooms, and private room listings into one unified ecosystem—with a strong emphasis on affordability, safety, and real-time proximity to event venues.
