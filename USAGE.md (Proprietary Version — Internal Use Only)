# 🔑 3. Environment Variables

Environment files (**.env**) must be stored **locally only** and **must NOT** be committed under any circumstance.

### Create `.env` in `/backend` and `/frontend`:

Example `.env` variables:

DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/lodgr
JWT_SECRET=your_internal_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_key
MAP_API_KEY=your_mapbox_or_google_key
STORAGE_BUCKET=your_cloud_storage_bucket


> Never send `.env` files over public channels.  
> Use encrypted channels for key distribution.
